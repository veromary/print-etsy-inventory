# print-etsy-inventory
upload your active listings csv and see titles and thumbnails

Go straight to [the working online demo](http://veromary.github.io/print-etsy-inventory)

My husband has an [Etsy Shop](http://avalonprand.etsy.com) with hundreds of listings.  He keeps drawings for Etsy on a separate shelf but sometimes the system gets out of sync.

It should be really easy to print out a list of titles and thumbnails to check.

Here is my stab at it using [jquery-csv](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv)

To download your Etsy store's csv you go to "Shop Settings" > "Options" > "Download Data" and click the Download CSV button for your Currently for Sale Listings.

Then take your EtsyListingsDownload.csv and [upload to print etsy inventory](http://veromary.github.io/print-etsy-inventory)

I've hard coded this to fit the current CSV produced by Etsy.

Enjoy!
